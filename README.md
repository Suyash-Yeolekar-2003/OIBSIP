Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks that allowed me to gain valuable experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. Here is a description of the five tasks I completed:

1. Iris Flower Classification:
Developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. Achieved accurate species prediction using machine learning algorithms.

2. Unemployment Analysis with Python:
Analyzed unemployment data using Python, exploring trends and visualizing patterns.

3. Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning:
Built a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various attributes such as mileage, brand, model, and year. Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

4. Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning:
Developed a machine learning model to detect spam emails. Processed text data, extracted relevant features, and trained a classification model to accurately identify spam emails.

5. Sales Prediction using Python:
Predicted sales using historical data, considering influential factors and applying time series forecasting techniques. Conducted data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Through completing these tasks, I gained practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling techniques. I developed skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, which are crucial for real-world applications in various industries.
